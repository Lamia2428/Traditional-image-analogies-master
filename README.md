 Given an image A, a related image A', and a new image B, our goal in this project is to be able to compute an image B' that is related to B in the same way that A' is related to A. This concept will be referred to as an image analogy. In this project we try to implement the traditional image analogy paper and apply it on a video to transfer texture from source image to a target video.
The paper we  used   “ Image Analogies “ introduces an  image processing framework which  operates in two phases: a design phase, where a paired set of images is used as training data, and an application phase, where the learned filter is applied to a new target image to produce an analogous filtered result. The approach relies on multiscale autoregression, inspired by recent advancements in texture synthesis. The framework accommodates various image filter effects, including traditional filters (e.g., blurring or embossing), improved texture synthesis, super-resolution, texture transfer, and artistic filters that emulate different drawing and painting styles. The flexibility of this approach allows for diverse applications in image processing tasks
